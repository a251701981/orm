Bravo3 ORM 0.6.0 Major Release
==============================
This is a non-BC major change for the ORM to clean up mistakes in early development.

Goals
-----
* Clean up index names
* Overhaul unit tests
* Overhaul documentation
    * Now available on [http://bravo3.info/](http://bravo3.info/orm/index.html) via 
      [git@github.com:bravo3/documentation.git](https://github.com/bravo3/documentation)
* Address refs quirk
* Add integrity checker
* Schema change support
* Score-based query range
* Persisting a new entity promotes it to a proxy object

Index Naming
------------
* Table index -> unique key
    * Force uniqueness
* Table sortable -> sorted table index (done)
* Relationship -> [unsorted] relationship (leave alone)
* Relationship sortable -> sorted relationship index (done)
* Indexed query -> key scan (done)

New Indices
-----------
* unsorted table index? (won't implement)

PHP 7 Entities
==============
Entities taking advantage of scalar type hints and return types will not be supported on the launch of this release due
to the requirement that an entity must be wrapped in a proxy. Until the proxy manager can support this, it is impossible
for the entity manager to fully support PHP 7 entities.

See: [Ocramius/ProxyManager](https://github.com/Ocramius/ProxyManager/issues/240)

Consider: exploring other proxy managers?
