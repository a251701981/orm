Bravo 3 Bravo3 Object Relational-Document Mapper (ORDM)
=======================================================
This is an experimental project, a work in progress.

Purpose
-------
The purpose of this library is to blend ORM and ODM fundamentals with NoSQL database platforms, allowing you to use 
NoSQL databases with pseudo-relationships through means of a traditional entity manager.

Supported Databases
-------------------
This library could work with any database server by adding new drivers, however the only bundled driver is **Redis**.
